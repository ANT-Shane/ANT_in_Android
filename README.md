ANT in Android
===============

This repository contains an example local_manifest.xml to be placed under .repo/ in your build root directory.  The ANT repositories will then be picked up with a 'repo sync'.

For details on adding ANT to the Android platform source, see https://github.com/ant-wireless/ANT_in_Android/wiki
